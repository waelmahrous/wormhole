# wormhole

### Teleport files between terminals without thinking about paths.

**wormhole** is a tiny shell utility that lets you “open” a destination in one terminal, then instantly send or copy to it from anywhere else. No more typing long paths, no more hunting for the right directory. If you already have a terminal open where you want things to go, that location becomes your wormhole.

This is the proof of concept script I wrote to find out if this was a stupid idea or not. It seems
to be equal amounts stupid and useful.
